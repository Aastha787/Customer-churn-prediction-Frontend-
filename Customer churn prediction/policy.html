            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p >The customer churn prediction (CCP) is one of the challenging problems in the telecom industry. With the advancement in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the possibilities to predict customer churn has increased significantly. Our proposed methodology, consists of six phases. In the first two phases, data pre-processing and feature analysis is performed. In the third phase, feature selection is taken into consideration using gravitational search algorithm. Next, the data has been split into two parts train and test set in the ratio of 80% and 20% respectively.  </p>
